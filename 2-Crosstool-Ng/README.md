# Crosstool-NG
CrossTool-NG is a versatile tool for building toolchains across different architectures. It facilitates cross-compilation, allowing software development for platforms distinct from the build system. With its modular design, CrossToolNG streamlines the creation and customization of toolchains, enhancing efficiency in embedded systems development.
## Steps to configure the toolchain
In order to make an avr compiler customized you need to download crosstool-ng
 - By cloning it from the repo: [Croostool-NG[]([https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository)](https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng.git)
 - after cloning the repo much better to checkout to the following commit: **25f6dae8**

| Command | Definition |
| ------ | ------ |
| ./bootstrap | to setup the environment |
| ./configure --enable-local | to check all dependencies |
| make | to generate a makefile for Crosstool-NG |
| ./ct-ng list-samples | to list all microcontrollers supported |
| ./ct-ng [Microcontroller] | to configure the Microcontroller used |
| ./ct-ng makemenuconfig | to configure the toolchain |
| ./ct-ng build | to build your toolchain |
##### You will face allot of libraries missing you need to get it by sudo apt install.
```
sudo apt install build-essential git autoconf bison flex texinfo help2man gawk \
libtool-bin libncurses5-dev unzip
```
##### _Once the build is complete you will notice x-tool file created on your home directory Under avr/bin you will see all binutil_
#### for arm-cortexa9_neon-linux-musleabihf:
###### You are required to customize an arm toolchain for your project.Make sure it support:
 - Musl library
 - Make
 - Strace

## Sysroot Explanation:
A sysroot serves as the root filesystem for the target system during cross-compilation. It contains all necessary files and libraries required to build and run software for the target architecture.

- **Sysroot Directory Structure**: 
  - `/usr/lib`: Contains necessary shared libraries (*.so) for dynamically linking executables, as well as static libraries (*.a) if statically linking.
  - `/etc`: Holds system configuration files required by the software being built.
  - `/lib`: May include additional shared libraries or kernel-essential system libraries.
  - `/usr/include`: Typically holds header files (*.h) for compilation compatibility.
  - `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, etc.: Contain executable files required by the software being built.
  - Other directories may exist based on the specific requirements of the target system or software being developed.

- **Target System Requirements**:
  - The sysroot should include all necessary files, libraries, and configuration settings required for the target system to run the software.
  - It should mirror the directory structure and essential files present on the target system to ensure compatibility and proper functioning.

## Binutil Explanation:
Binutils are a collection of binary utilities, including programs for assembling, linking, and manipulating binary files for various architectures. They are essential components of a toolchain, providing the necessary tools to create executable files and libraries.

- **Usage**: Binutils are typically invoked during the build process to assemble source code, link object files, and create executable binaries or libraries.
- **Components**: Binutils include programs such as `as` (assembler), `ld` (linker), `ar` (archive), `objdump` (object file disassembler), and `nm` (symbol table viewer), among others.
- **Cross-Compilation**: Binutils can be configured and built to target specific architectures, enabling cross-compilation for different platforms.

## Conclusion:
By customizing the ARM toolchain and understanding the sysroot and binutils, developers can create efficient and optimized software for ARM-based embedded systems. This setup enables seamless cross-compilation, ensuring compatibility and performance for target devices.
